# Overview
Implementation of I2C protocol using GPIO port. No i2c hardware module is required. So any GPIO pins in STM32 can be used as i2c.   
This example demonstrates GPIO IIC using MPU6050, MS5611, HMC5883.  
Original work uses Bit banding technique.   
# How to
Reader sensor's `.c` file to change or review IIC pins.
