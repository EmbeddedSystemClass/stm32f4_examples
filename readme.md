My STM32 projects codehub.
# Brief
ARM Cortex M4
# Note
## Example project
### Keil IDE
`template_keilc` is a pre-configured project using Keil uVision IDE.
To run the project. You have to correctly set the Include Paths to the folder contains files used in the project.  
In uVision. Click `'Options for Target'` -> `C/C++` -> `Include Paths`.  
### GNU toolchain
`template_gcc` is sample project for building with GNU toolchain.

## Many project examples already come with libraries from STMicroelectronics, i.e:
+ STM32-Discovery_FW_V1.10/Project
+ STM32F4xx_DSP_StdPeriph_Lib_V1.3.0/Project
+ STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.16.0
