# Brief
This project use previous PWM to 4 LEDs project. 
PA7 is PWM input.
Watch 2 variables Duty cycle (%) and frequency (Hz) in stm32f4xx_it.c file
# NOTE:
1. understand the priciple of PWM input measurement.
2. Frequency of PWM signals and frequency of PWM input measurement -> program otherwise things may go wrong.
